Ok, so there are multiple stages to marketing this. Better get to it then.

1.) Clean GitHub library Repo + Demo Repo. Kinda already happening. I test all my code on an STM32 Cortex M4 hardware in the loop.

2.) Clean Documentation Website, MkDocs, Doxygen, Github pages

3.) Youtube tutorial + Dev.to tutorial series
  - video/article on how to go away from vendor IDE to modern CMake + vscode + openocd + gdb server + run hello world and led blink example and use the debugger to step through
 - video/article on how to use CPM for embedded systems and download embedOS
 - video/article on in-depth embedOS and how it works on surfache level and also under the hood to de-mystify it.
 - additional videos/articles on usage exampleas.

4.) Try to get on talks - cppcon would be the dream. Also isn't there an effort by the c++ commitee for embedded?

5.) handle all the issues and support tickets on GitHub XD. Then i will probably regret the unpaied work. Hopefully I get donations.

6.) Live from donations and a high paying job, knowing that I am a known programmer and would be hired instantly anywhere - or give private lessons/teachings or work self employed as an advisor.

Ok - i think thats a roadmap right there
